# MCP Server Extension Project Planning Instructions

---

## Project Overview

This project implements an extensible MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to extend GitHub capabilities. The server can be called from other repositories via their `mcp.json` files, providing a list of available MCP servers and supporting dynamic configuration, argument passing, and custom logic (e.g., persona prompt selection).

## Key Architectural Decisions

- **Containerization:** The server will run in a Docker container for portability and deployment consistency.
- **Extensibility:** The architecture will support plug-in MCP configs and logic modules, allowing new features and personas to be added with minimal changes.
- **Dynamic Argument Handling:** The server will accept arguments from calling repos (e.g., persona selection) and route requests accordingly.
- **MCP Protocol Compliance:** The server will adhere to MCP standards for interoperability with other tools and repos.
- **API-first Design:** Expose clear, versioned endpoints for all MCP operations.
- **Config-driven Logic:** Allow new logic and personas to be added via config files or plugins, without code changes.

## Coding Conventions

- Use clear, modular code structure (e.g., separate logic for config loading, argument parsing, persona handling).
- Follow best practices for Node.js/TypeScript (or Python, if preferred) and Docker.
- Document all extensibility points and configuration options.
- Write comprehensive tests for all logic modules.

## Security & Performance

- Validate and sanitize all incoming arguments and configs.
- Restrict access to sensitive endpoints and environment variables.
- Optimize for low-latency response to MCP requests.
- Use environment variables for secrets and sensitive configs.

## Documentation

- Provide clear setup, usage, and extension instructions.
- Document the process for adding new MCP configs and personas.
- Include API reference and example requests/responses.

## Future Features & Refinements

- Web dashboard for managing configs, personas, and server status
- Plugin system for custom logic and integrations
- Support for additional protocols (e.g., REST, gRPC)
- Advanced persona logic (e.g., chaining, context memory)
- Role-based access control and audit logging
- Integration with other code hosts (GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Automated update and deployment tools
- Monitoring, alerting, and analytics for server usage
