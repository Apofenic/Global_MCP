# Global MCP Server - Alternative Planning Instructions

---

## Project Overview

The Global MCP Server is a containerized, extensible MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to act as a central hub for GitHub-enhanced capabilities. It serves as a meta-server that can aggregate and provide access to multiple MCP servers through a unified interface. Calling repositories can invoke this server via their `mcp.json` configurations to access a curated list of MCP services, persona prompts, and custom GitHub integrations.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Core Architecture
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker-based deployment for consistency across environments
- **Meta-Server Pattern**: Acts as a proxy/aggregator for multiple underlying MCP servers
- **Plugin-Based Extensibility**: Modular architecture allowing new MCP configurations and logic to be added without core changes
- **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior controlled through external configuration files and environment variables

### MCP Protocol Implementation
- **Standard Compliance**: Full adherence to MCP protocol specifications
- **Dynamic Server Discovery**: Runtime discovery and registration of available MCP servers
- **Request Routing**: Intelligent routing of MCP requests to appropriate underlying servers
- **Response Aggregation**: Combining responses from multiple servers when applicable

### GitHub Integration
- **Enhanced GitHub API**: Extended GitHub capabilities beyond standard API
- **Repository Context Awareness**: Understanding of calling repository context and permissions
- **Cross-Repository Operations**: Ability to perform operations across multiple repositories
- **Webhook Integration**: Support for GitHub webhook processing and event handling

### Persona System
- **Dynamic Persona Selection**: Runtime selection of AI personas based on calling repository arguments
- **Persona Configuration**: YAML/JSON-based persona definitions with prompts, behaviors, and capabilities
- **Context Injection**: Automatic injection of repository and user context into persona prompts
- **Persona Chaining**: Support for complex workflows involving multiple personas

## Technical Stack Considerations

- **Runtime**: Node.js/TypeScript for async I/O and MCP protocol handling
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration with JSON Schema validation
- **Storage**: File-based configuration with optional database backend for scaling
- **Networking**: HTTP/WebSocket support for MCP protocol variations
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging and metrics collection

## Security & Performance

### Security
- **Token Management**: Secure handling of GitHub tokens and API keys
- **Request Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all incoming MCP requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and API quota management
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations and configurations
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permission requirements for all operations

### Performance
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching of GitHub API responses and MCP server metadata
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient management of connections to underlying MCP servers
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking request handling for high concurrency
- **Resource Optimization**: Memory and CPU optimization for container environments

## Extensibility Framework

### Plugin System
- **Dynamic Loading**: Runtime loading of new MCP server configurations
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper initialization, health checking, and cleanup of plugins
- **Dependency Management**: Handling of plugin dependencies and version compatibility
- **Isolation**: Proper isolation between plugins to prevent interference

### Configuration Schema
- **Versioned Schemas**: Support for configuration schema evolution
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all configuration inputs
- **Hot Reloading**: Runtime configuration updates without server restart
- **Environment Override**: Environment-specific configuration overrides

## Documentation Standards

- **API Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- **Plugin Development**: Comprehensive guide for developing custom plugins
- **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step deployment and configuration instructions
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and resolution procedures
